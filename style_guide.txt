use file namespace whenever possible

newline before curly bracket pairs (UNLESS in: object initialization, delegates, Actions when passed in as an argument, or empty pairs)

no space after if/else/catch/while/for/etc
  NO:  if (condition)
  YES: if(condition)

public goes after private in most cases

order of class members (suggested but really idc):
  const
  static field
  field
  static property
  property
  class / enum / struct / interface
  private constructor(s)
  constructor(s)
  methods
